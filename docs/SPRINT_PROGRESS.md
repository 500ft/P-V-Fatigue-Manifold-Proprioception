# Sprint progress — P-V-Fatigue-Manifold-Proprioception

## 2026-09-06 — Main-branch placement authorized

Owner explicitly requested these PRs be merged to their respective main branches. This supersedes earlier placement-blocked/draft-only entries for the current changes. The combined main-targeted PR retains prerequisite integrity work, unchanged task ledgers and all actual hardware/disclosure gates. No CAD or experiment is marked complete. Merge completion and resulting main commit are verified by GitHub rather than asserted in advance here.

## 2026-09-06 — Reviewer-driven CAD amendment

This entry supersedes the earlier CAD allocation and readiness wording. The same CAD PR is now draft, pending the owner planning-ledger placement decision. [Review disposition](CAD_REVIEW_DISPOSITION.md) records that block; [CAD_PLAN.md](CAD_PLAN.md) and [CAD_TASKS.csv](CAD_TASKS.csv) contain revised priorities, separate tooling estimates and explicit parked work. No CAD model or new measurement was produced. Original integrity-sprint tasks/evidence remain unchanged. Next work is limited to active input-register tasks and unresolved owner decisions, not the parked portfolio-wide CAD program.

## 2026-09-06 — CAD task amendment

Added [individual CAD work orders](CAD_PLAN.md) and [CAD_TASKS.csv](CAD_TASKS.csv), separating component modeling, fixtures, inspection and release deliverables. This is planning only: no CAD or physical task is complete. The original sprint ledger and evidence are unchanged. CAD branch: `plan/cad-tasks-20260906`; the PR supplies the committed source identity. Next CAD action: the first input-register task in the CAD ledger; owner-gated successors remain blocked. Verification of this amendment is recorded in [CAD_PLAN_CHECKS.md](CAD_PLAN_CHECKS.md).

## 2026-09-06 — Partial handoff

- Sprint start2026-09-05; canonical checkout `/Users/redhose/Developer/research-sprints/2026-09-05/P-V-Fatigue-Manifold-Proprioception`.
- Branch `sprint/evidence-integrity-20260905`; HEAD/base `88d24358bc385dc66c2c0a9ab3c295b059d13427`.
- Seven Agent tasks done with linked evidence; PV-08 blocked on: Author reconciliation of dirty drafts, final PDF approval and publication account action. Existing local v2 documents are reported uncommitted, not adopted as preregistration.
- 141 tests passed; manuscript-number and historical PDF checks passed; deposit check exits2 intentionally.
- [Final checks](../evidence/sprint-2026-09-05/final-checks.json), [candidate](../evidence/sprint-2026-09-05/candidate.json), [original expectations](../evidence/sprint-2026-09-05/evaluation-plan.md), [outcomes](../evidence/sprint-2026-09-05/evaluation.json).
- These are developer software checks; no physical/new scientific results. Catan's real-data arm, where applicable, stays blocked despite its software fallback evaluation.
- Handoff was prepared before commit; the PR records the final commit and push. Original user changes remain untouched.
- Next verification command: `python evidence/sprint-2026-09-05/evaluate_candidate.py`.
- Exact next task: PV-08: author review of docs/preprint_v1_4_candidate.md; no deposit of archived v1.3.

## Baseline and interrupted execution

Baseline commands, outputs and identity remain in [evidence](../evidence/sprint-2026-09-05/baseline.json). Plans were saved before behavior changes. Runtime-limit pauses were followed by resuming the existing worktree; no baseline or external reply was invented. Original failing cases and corrected behavior are linked in [REVIEW_READY.md](REVIEW_READY.md).
